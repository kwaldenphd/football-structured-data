# Next Steps (aka, now it's your turn!)

By this point in the lab we've covered a number of different tools for analyzing data from primary sources using digital and computational tools, including some that run in a web browser, some that run on your local computer, and some that involve working within a programming language.

Now it's your turn to come up with a small-scale question, topic, etc. related to the period of ND football history we've been looking at (or some of the broader themes we've been talking about) that you could explore using some of the primary sources and analysis/research methods covered in this lab.

## Part I: Research question (or topic)

Background or context for the research question or topic you're exploring
- At least 250  words (or 3 minutes audio/video) on how the question you're asking or topic you're exploring is grounded in the texts we've been reading and conversations we've been having about ND football history and cultural significance.
  * To put it another way, this is a "background" section.

## Part II: Curating Data

Sources and research/analysis methods you'll be using
- At least 200 words (or 2 minutes audio/video) on how the specific sources you're engaging with and research/analysis methods you're using animate or connect to the question(s) you're asking or the topic(s) you're exploring.
  * To put it another way, this is a "methods" or "methodology" section

## Part III: Preliminary Findings

What you found through the exploration/analysis
- At least 250 words (or 3 minutes audio/video) on what you found through analyzing this source material using specific research/analysis methods. Folks are encouraged to include visualizations/screenshots/figures/etc in this section.
  * To put it another way, this is a "findings" section

## Part IV: Conclusions & Next Steps

Conclusions and next steps
- At least 250 words (or 2-3 minutes audio/video) on how your findings relate to the broader context or background you outlined at the start of the report.
- Questions to address:
  * How can the work you did in this lab inform how we think about or understand ND football's history and cultural significance? How does it connect to the readings and conversations we've been having in class?
  * Where would you go next with this research? What questions emerged through doing this work? What questions were you not able to address? 
    * To put it another way, this is a hybrid "discussion" and "conclusion" section

## Part V: Individual Reflection

At least 200 words (or 2-3 minutes audio/video) from each member of the group, addressing the following questions:
- Your contribution to the lab report
- Challenges you faced in this lab and how you solved them
- What you learned about text analysis through this lab
- How you're thinking about text analysis (and ND football history/primary sources) differently after this lab
- Other comments/questions/observations

## Other Components
- Any CSV or Excel files (or Google Sheets projects) you created or worked with (that aren't already in the Lab 2 Google Drive)
- Any Python scripts/Jupyter Notebooks (or RStudio/RMarkdown files) you created or used

# Collaborating Well

Collaboration is also your friend here- you don't have to come up with all the ideas or do all the work on your own. For example, folks with data processing skills can focus on curationg datasets. Folks who are more comfortable with statistical analysis and/or data analysis/visualization can focus on those aspects of the project. Others can focus on the components of the lab that ask you to think about background/context/broader significance.

In short, leverage the group's strengths. And divide/conquer.

Folks are welcome to meet with me (individually or as a group) to ask questions and think about next steps for how to approach this lab.

# Where to Start: Articulating a Research Question or Topic

Our end-point for this class is an open-ended final project that takes up course topics/themes/etc. This lab is not a final project.

We'll have in-class work time on Thursday 11/2 to continue working on this lab, and folks should anticipate spending 5-7 hours (total) outside class time working on this lab.

Given the limited scope of this assignment, I encourage folks to drill down and narrow their focus for what you want to analyze or explore.
- This could be a particular player, team, or coach. 
- Or you could focus on a particular season or period of time. 
- It could be a specific publication or type of source material.

The final project is a space where you take up more advanced computational methods or engage in larger-scale, multi-faceted research questions- hanging out in the world of exploratory data analysis is absolutely fine for this lab.

For now, think about the questions you might be interested in asking or the topics you might be interested in exploring- we've already done some brainstorming in this direction with our in-class work.

# Addressing Your Research Question

Any of the tools and methods covered in this lab are fair game. Folks are also welcome to branch out and/or go more deeply into any of these areas, keeping in mind the limited assignment scope. The tools you choose and the analysis methods you land on should be driven by your topic/question and what you want to know about it.

Ferdio's [DataVizProject](https://datavizproject.com/) is a useful resource to explore different types of visualization for structured data.

# Lab Notebook Resources

[Link to Google Drive folder with lab materials and resources, including notebook template](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1BYuxNOQ-FoWuYtL8hVWZq0Re-FInkXr3?usp=sharing) (ND Users)

Components:
- Reflections/observations from exploratory data analysis/visualization section of the lab
- Reflections/observations from the mapping section of the lab
- Reflections/observations from the networks section of the lab
- Any data files you worked with (that aren't in the sample datasets)
- If you worked with Python/RStudio: Scripts or notebooks for any original code you generated

If youâ€™re working in or using Google Drive, you can download the project folder as a compressed zip folder and submit to Canvas. You can also include a link to the Google Drive folder as part of the lab notebook.
