# Table of Contents

# Background

To prepare for this lab, we read POSNER and explored POSNER.

Discussion Questions:
Something data historical/cultural research questions

# University Archive Digital Collections

Something about primary sources as structured data.

Focus on things like rosters, directories, etc.

# Sample Datasets

## Things to Take Away From This Section

Develping a data model is hard

Developing a data model takes time

Reproducability and version control are your friends

In the words of Tim Gunn, make it work.

When you start doing this on your own, we'll talk in more detail about tools/workflows/strategies/etc.
